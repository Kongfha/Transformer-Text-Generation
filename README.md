# Transformer-Text-Generation
*This respiratory is used for Text-Generation Model deployment using streamlit*

In this project, the Text-Generation Model were composed by using Encoder-Decoder Transformer model trained on `The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimmsâ€™ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm` Dataset. With generation sampling technique using greedy approach.
